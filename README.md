## Primary findings

* Maximum thickness of Jowell knives differs significantly between the two sites.

* Jowell knives recovered from 41AN13 are both significantly thinner (Chapter 1) and broader (Chapter 2) than those recovered from 41HS261.

* Results provide the requisite foundation needed to advance discussions of differential skill in Jowell knife production and maintenance.
