# Preface {-}

>Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918].

This volume is written in **Markdown**, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Typology is the topic of this particular undertaking, and typological assignments provide the requisite foundation for many of the assumptions, inferences, and interpretations that archaeologists regularly make. Diagnostic types---whether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological [@RN20847]---are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations.

## Primary findings

* Jowell knives from 41HS261 are significantly thicker than those from 41AN13.

* Jowell knives recovered from 41AN13 are broader in shape than those recovered from 41HS261.

* Results provide the requisite foundation needed to advance discussions of differential skill in Jowell knife production and maintenance.
