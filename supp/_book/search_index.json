Selden, Jr. 2020-10-02 Preface Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written in Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the following chapters. The replicable nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Typology is the topic of this particular undertaking, and typological assignments provide the requisite foundation for many of the assumptions, inferences, and interpretations that archaeologists regularly make. Diagnostic types—whether functional, decorative, morphological, or chronological (O’Brien and Lyman 1999)—are of considerable import in formulating archaeological interpretations. 0.1 Primary findings Maximum thickness of Jowell knives differs significantly between the two sites. Jowell knives from 41AN13 are both significantly thinner (Chapter 1), and significntly broader (Chapter 2). Results provide a solid foundation for potential discussions of differential skill in Jowell knife manufacture and maintenance. 0.2 Data management The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through GitHub, and that repository is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/CS436.
